The official [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) is amazing. But the local setup instructions are too advanced for someone who just wants to hack demos in their spare time and not get a front-end developer job. 

This repo contains a simpler local setup for the Tic-Tac-Toe demo from the React tutorial. To run it, just launch Python's default HTTP Server (`python -m http.server`) and open `localhost:8000/app.html` in your browser. It's that easy!

This folder contains:
- `app.js` - the React code!
- `app.css` - the style file
- `app.html` - the HTML file that does not do much more than loading the React library and the two above files.

Enjoy hacking your demos!
